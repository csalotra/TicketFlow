# TicketFlow 🚀

TicketFlow is a **RESTful API** built with **FastAPI** and **SQLite**, designed as a **practice/refresher project** for building modern backend systems.  

The project demonstrates **JWT authentication, role-based access, and CRUD operations** in a structured FastAPI application. It is intentionally iterative, with plans for **future enhancements**, including AI-assisted ticket management.
